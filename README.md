**Project Overview**

This document outlines a proposal for developing a comprehensive tourist website focused on showcasing Algeria's captivating destinations. The website will cater to tourists seeking information and planning their itineraries, offering a user-friendly platform to discover:

-   **Main Sites:** Highlight prominent landmarks and must-see attractions.

-   **Activities:** Provide details on available tours and experiences.

-   **Accommodation:** Offer listings of hotels and places to stay.

-   **Dining:** Showcase restaurants and eateries for tourists' culinary ventures.

The website will be structured into distinct pages, each catering to specific user needs:

-   **Landing Page:**

    -   Hero Section: Captivating visuals and a brief introduction to Algeria's tourism scene.

    -   Discover Section: Advanced search functionality with filters based on tags for a personalized experience.

    -   Mini Sections: Teasers for other key pages like "What to Do," "What to See," etc.

-   **Dedicated Pages:**

    -   Each page (What to Do, What to See, Where to Stay, Where to Eat) will house detailed information with:

        -   Content sections showcasing relevant attractions and establishments.

        -   Filter Sidebar: Allow users to refine their search based on criteria like star ratings and price range.

        -   Search Area : Enable keyword-based searches for specific locations or points of interest.

-   **Login/Register:** Facilitate user accounts (optional) for future enhancements.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This proposed timeline assumes the backend functionality is already developed or will be handled by a separate team. Due to current commitments with my part-time job and pursuing a Master's degree, I would prefer to dedicate focused development efforts on this project starting from **July 2024**, Inshallah. However, I remain available throughout May and June for any further discussions, adjustments, or content gathering tasks.
